    "# Online mean and variance estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "The first technique we'll introduce isn't a probabilistic structure at all, but it will serve as a warm-up to introduce some of the more involved concepts we'll look at later.  We'll look at [Chan's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Parallel_algorithm) for online mean and variance estimates, so that we can calculate estimated mean and variance in a single pass over a large data set.  As we'll see, this technique will also let us combine estimates for several data sets (i.e., for processing a partitioned collection in parallel)."
